    <h2>About Bridge Designer</h2>
    <div class="para">
      Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition is a free web application for learning about engineering design. The user solves
      the problem of designing and testing a highway bridge across a river. The test involves driving a standard truck
      load over the bridge to ensure it's strong enough. But that's not all! The <i>most successful</i> bridge is the
      one with lowest cost. The Bridge Designer continuously shows the cost of the current design based on the amount of
      preparation required at the bridge site, the design's complexity, and the kind and amount of materials used.
      Iterate to see how low you can get the cost of your bridge! Compete to see whose is best!
    </div>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <div class="para">
      There's a small warning that goes with this site. This is a pre-release. There's a small risk of remaining bugs.
      Major ones are unlikely. Hundreds of teachers and kids have already reported success and no major problems.
      Features won't change further.
    </div>
    <div class="para">
      Another tiny risk is that too many users will exceed Github's bandwidth limits. If it happens, we'll need to shut
      down this site until completion of a sponsorship deal, which will include unlimited bandwidth support. We expect
      to give fair warning if that should happen.
    </div>
    <div class="para">We thank Github for their incredibly gracious support!</div>

                >Is the Cloud Edition related to earlier apps Bridge Designer, Engineering Encounters Bridge Designer,
                and West Point Bridge Designer?</span
              >
              Yes! All the older versions were desktop applications for Windows and Mac. Many users have asked for a
              version to run on Chromebook and other platforms with only a web browser. We answered with the Cloud
              Edition. It's engineered to seem as similar as possible to the old versions. Existing teacher experience
              and lesson plans are still good to go!

              <span class="bold">Is anything new?</span> Yes! Fly-through test visualization, 3d printing support, and
              more. For details, see "What's new?" in the Help of Bridge Designer.

              <span class="bold">What's the catch?</span> None! Use Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition freely as much as you
              like for educational purposes only. The source is also freely available under the GNU public license, v3.

              <span class="bold">Can Cloud Edition and earlier version bridge files be used interchangeably?</span>
              No. For many reasons, Cloud Edition can't load previous version files and vice versa. This is nothing new.
              Older versions did not support file exchange either.

              <span class="bold">Cloud Edition starts where I left off last time! What's up with that?</span>
              Unlike most apps, Cloud Edition periodically stashes all your work in a place called &quot;browser local
              storage&quot;. This means you can reload or close the tab and re-open later without fear. But a few
              things...
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="bold">Save your work to files!</span> Local storage is cool, but has limits as explained
                  below. Saving your work to files is still the safest way to go.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">It only works within the same device and browser!</span> Local storage is local.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Cloud Edition updates may hurt.</span> After we fix bugs or make improvements,
                    your next use might start fresh rather than where you left off. This is rare, but it can happen.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Local storage is a bit fragile.</span> There are unlikely but possible ways that
                    local storage can fail or be deleted.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="bold">You can turn it off!</span> If you don't want your work saved in local storage,
                  just uncheck <span class="bold">Edit | Remember my work</span>. If you share a user ID with another
                  person on the same computer and want to keep your design secret, this is a way to do it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="bold">You can force a reset!</span> If Cloud Edition ever fails to start up, it may be
                  that your local storage was somehow corrupted. Make a fresh start by adding
                  <span class="bold">?reset</span> to the end of the Cloud Edition URL.
                </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              <span class="bold">How do local contest codes work?</span> Conduct your own contest locally for any set of
              site conditions you choose. For this, you'll need to select a local contest code and furnish it to all
              contestants. They enter it on page 2 of the new bridge setup wizard and start designing!
            </div>
            <div class="para">
              Codes are always exactly 6 characters. The first 3 are any digits you choose. Bridge Designer doesn't
              care. For the last 3, use the new bridge setup wizard (with no local contest code) to choose your contest
              site conditions. Before pressing <span class="bold">Finish</span>, look at the wizard's lower right
              corner. You'll see something like <span class="bold">Site conditions: 12A</span>. The three final
              characters (12A in this example) are the last three of your local contest code. Have fun!

          <li>
            <div>
              <span class="bold">Why does Cloud Edition ask for save file names often?</span> Browsers have security
              features to prevent bad guys from modifying files on your computer via the Internet. One such feature is
              asking for a file name to verify you know exactly what's being written. This is a good thing, even if it's
              a bit more trouble.
