    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>General stuff...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold"
            >How is the Cloud Edition related to earlier apps called Bridge Designer, Engineering Encounters Bridge
            Designer, and West Point Bridge Designer?</span
          >
          All the older versions were desktop applications for Windows and Mac. Many users have asked for a version to
          run on Chromebook and other platforms. We answered with Cloud Edition. It's nearly the same so that teacher
          experience and old lesson plans are still good to go.

      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold">Is anything new?</span> Yes! Fly-through test visualization, 3d printing support, and more.
          For details, see "What's new?" in the Help of Bridge Designer.

      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold">What's the catch?</span> None! Use Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition freely as much as you
          like for educational purposes only.

    <h3>Using the Bridge Designer...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold">Can Cloud Edition and earlier version bridge files be used interchangeably?</span>
          No. For many reasons, Cloud Edition can't load previous version files and vice versa. This is nothing new.
          Older versions did not support file exchange either.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold"
            >When I return to Cloud Edition after not using it for a while, it picks up where I left off. What's up with
            that?</span
          >
          Cloud Edition periodically stashes all your work in a place called &quot;browser local storage&quot;. This
          means you can reload or close your tab and re-open later without fear. But a few things...
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">Save your work to files!</span> Local storage is cool, but has limits as explained
              below. Saving to files is still the best way to go.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">It only works for the same device and browser!</span> Local storage is local after
                all.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Changes on our end may affect you.</span> After we fix bugs or make improvements,
                your next use might start fresh rather than where you left off. It won't be often, but it can happen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Local storage is a bit fragile.</span> It's rare, but there are ways beyond Bridge
                Designer's control that local storage can fail or be deleted.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">You can turn it off!</span> If you don't want your work saved in local storage, just
              uncheck <span class="bold">Edit | Remember my work</span>. If you share a user ID with another person on
              the same computer and want to keep your design secret, this is a way to do it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">You can force a reset!</span> If Cloud Edition ever fails to start up, it may be that
              your local storage was somehow corrupted. Make a fresh start by adding <span class="bold">?reset</span> to
              the end of the Cloud Edition URL.

      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold">How do local contest codes work?</span> Conduct your own contest locally for any set of
          site conditions you choose. For this, you'll need to select a local contest code and furnish it to all
          contestants. They enter it on page 2 of the new bridge setup wizard and start designing!
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          Codes are always exactly 6 characters. The first 3 are any digits you choose. Bridge Designer doesn't care.
          For the last 3, use the new bridge setup wizard (with no local contest code) to choose your contest site
          conditions. Before pressing <span class="bold">Finish</span>, look at the wizard's lower right corner. You'll
          see something like <span class="bold">Site conditions: 12A</span>. The three final characters (12A in this
          example) are the last three of your local contest code. Have fun!

      <li>
        <div>
          <span class="bold">Why does Cloud Edition ask for save file names often?</span> Browsers have security
          features to prevent bad guys from modifying files on your computer via the Internet. One such feature is
          frequently asking for a file name to verify you know exactly what's being written. This is a good thing, even
          if it's a bit more trouble.
