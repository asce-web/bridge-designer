    <h2>About the app...</h2>
    <div class="para">
      ASCE Bridge Designer, Cloud Edition is the newest version of a free, open source application available since 2002.
      Millions have used it to learn basics of engineering design. Along with other improvements, this version makes
      Bridge Designer more accessible. Only a web browser and computer with a mouse-like pointer are needed. No software
      to install. Chromebooks work well. Get started with
      <a href="app?help=hlp_how_to">Bridge Designer help</a>. See <a href="faq.html">frequently asked questions</a> for
      more info.
    </div>
    <div class="para">
      Each user of Bridge Designer solves the problem of designing and testing a highway bridge. For the test, a
      simulated truck load drives over the bridge to ensure it's strong enough.
    </div>
    <div class="para">
      But that's not all! The <i>most successful</i> bridge is the one with lowest cost. ASCE Bridge Designer
      continuously shows the cost of the current design based on the amount of earth to be moved at the bridge site, the
      design's complexity, and the kind and amount of materials used. Iterate to see how low you can get the cost of
      your bridge! Compete to see whose is best!
